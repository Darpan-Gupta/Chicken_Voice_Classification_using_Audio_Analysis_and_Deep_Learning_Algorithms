# Chicken Voice Classification
The project aims at developing a deep learning model to recognize and classify various types of chicken sounds, enabling valuable insights into their emotional states and behaviors. This can facilitate the automated monitoring of poultry farms. To accomplish this, a thorough visit to a poultry farm was conducted and multiple sound samples of chickens were collected. The dataset was cleaned and pre-processed and labeled the samples into four distinct categories: alarm calls, egg-laying sounds, heat sounds, and feeding sounds.
